A cross-platform, offline-first Progressive Web App for secure file sharing over local Wi-Fi without internet connection.

## Features

- üîí **Secure P2P Transfer**: Direct file transfer using WebRTC DataChannel
- üåê **Offline-First**: No internet required after installation
- üì± **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern web browser

- üé® **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## How It Works

1. **Choose Role**: Select whether you want to send or receive a file
2. **Sender**: Pick a file and generate a connection offer (QR code)
3. **Receiver**: Scan the offer QR code and generate an answer
4. **Connect**: Sender scans the answer QR code to establish connection
5. **Transfer**: Files are sent directly over WebRTC DataChannel
6. **Complete**: Download the received file

## Technology Stack

- **WebRTC**: simple-peer for P2P connections
- **QR Codes**: qrcode.react, react-qr-reader
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **PWA**: Vite PWA plugin with service worker

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
